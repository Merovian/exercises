==EXERCISES

This is where I put some solutions to exercises I find around the web.

=Sequencer

Given the sequence 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ... write a program that gives 10 iterations. 
The sequence is verbal, and each iteration verbally describes the one preceeding it
(i.e.,  1,  one 1,  two 1s, one 2, one 1... etc).
